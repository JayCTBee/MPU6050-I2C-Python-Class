# MPU6050-I2C-Python-Class
Using an MPU6050 and its Digital Motion Processor (DMP) over I2C with Python on a Raspberry PI

A bunch of issues have been fixed from thisisG's Python Class with this repo (incorrect yaw calc, python3 syntax, replaced time.clock(), etc).

Try "python3 MPU6050_example.py" for reading sequence of roll, pitch and yaw
